			===========================
			PHP BLOG API IMPLEMENTATION
			===========================
 This library of PHP code was produced by the work of three people;
 	Beau Lebens
 	Bill Lazar
 	Kathryn Aaker
 
 The intention was to create a set of classes which provide access to the
 APIs of the most common web log systems - Blogger.com and MoveableType.

 They are based on the PHP XML-RPC library which availabled from
 http://xmlrpc.usefulinc.com/ and which is included in this distribution.
 
 This all started when Beau Lebens, the Primary Consultant of DentedReality
 (probably where you downloaded this) created a set of functions so that
 he could access the Blogger.com API.
 
 Bill Lazar then came along and turned those functions into an OO class,
 making the code more usable, more portable, and more extensible...
 
 Which was great, because when Kathryn Aaker came along and wanted to be
 able to modify a MoveableType web log, she just wrote a sub-class to Bill's
 "bloggerclient" class called "mtclient" and then everyone was happy :)
 
 Please email the authors directly with comments/feedback/bugs regarding
 this library, and also to share your project with us!
